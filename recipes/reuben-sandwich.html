    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Reuben sandwich is one of my family's fix-it-quick favorites. They are 
        really delicious and easy to make. I like to serve them with big bowls of 
        steaming vegetable soup and dill pickles on the side.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
        <li>Â½ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
        <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>8 slices deli sliced corned beef</li>
        <li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing.</li>
        <li>On four bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices corned beef, 
            1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining 
            bread slices, dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich.</li>
        <li>Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the 
            top of each sandwich with remaining butter. Grill until both sides are 
            golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
